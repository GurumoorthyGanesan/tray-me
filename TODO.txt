ToDo - TrayMe
--------------

* Command line traying program; wait for first window and tray it (ex: TrayMe.exe "Some Program.exe")
* Cmdline option: -h  -->  command line help
* Cmdline option: -s  -->  show window; do not hide to tray
* Cmdline option: -q  -->  quiet mode; display no command line errors
* Cmdline option: -x  -->  exit when trayed
- Untray last trayed window before new window is trayed (i.e. when from command line)
- Show window if tray icon is missing, but is still hidden
- Workaround the TrackContextMenu() "feature"
- Nmumonics in the context menu
- Multiple window traying
  - Window handle becomes a complex drop-down .. all items are trayed window handles
- TrayMe Hotkeys
  * Window-specific hotkeys
  - Assign window-specific hotkeys to a particular hotkey
  - Win+T - Tray/Untray current window
- Cmdline option: -k  -->  hotkey
- Protect from multiple subclasses
  (when unmapping, if current subclass proc ptr does not match window's subclass proc ptr, then DO NOT unmap, but instead
  continue to use current subclass's proc ptr (WndPric) until it matches window's subclass proc ptr, then unmap as normal).
